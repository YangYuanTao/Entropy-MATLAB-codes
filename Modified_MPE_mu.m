function [Out_mvMPE]=Modified_MPE_mu(X,m,Scale)
%
% To improve the stabily and reliabilty of multivaraite multiscale entropy (mvMSE) based on mean (mvMSE_mu), especially for short signals, we proposed refined composite mvMSE (RCmvMSE_mu). In RCmvMSE_mu, for scale
%factor tau, tau different multivaraite time series, corresponding to different starting points of the coarse-graining process are created and the RCmvMSE_mu value is defined based on
%the averages of the total number of m- and m+1- dimensional matched vector pairs of those shifted sequences.
